# ‚ö†Ô∏è About 
The goal of Batlez is to improve frame rate, latency, connection, privacy, security, and overall performance. Batlez maximizes and tweaks your PC for peak performance. You do not need to install any compiled software; simply run any simple script you want. It is free and open-source.


# üõë Getting Started 
This application is compatible with Windows 10 21H1. I haven't tried it on earlier versions. I would not because tinkering with anything on any PC can result in strange errors and glitches if not thoroughly tested on each Windows version. So don't come to me crying if you have problems with Windows Vista after installing it. I'm also unsure if this will work with Windows 11, so proceed cautiously!

**You MUST have an internet connection for the program to work!!**
