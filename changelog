------------------------
Batlez Tweak Folder V1.1

-Redo everything in my Batlez Tweaks batch file. Much simpler to read and to execute commands.

-Added more Powerplans.

-Made a separate folder for Fixes (go take a look).

-Added more batch files under Privacy. You can now disable Windows 10 spying on you.

-Added some .reg files under the fole Regedit. Mostly for the graphics card.

-Fixed some lines of code in some of the batch files. They all do as told.

-added a debloat.bat in Bloatware Apps. It has two modes, Normal and Advanced. I recommend just running the Normal mode. Also I added a high performance.reg that changes almost all the important registry. I don't recommend running this either, I haven't tested to see the benefits/disadvantages.

Batlez Tweak Folder V1.0

Batlez Tweaks aims at improving frame rate, latency, connection, privacy, security, and overall performance. Begin by launching the program. There will occasionally be check-boxes/folders to select tweaks. It will apply any changes you make after you select them. There is no need to install any compiled software on your system; simply run the simple script. Free and open-source (both free as in beer and free as in speech).

NOTE: THIS IS PRE-RELEASE. THERE WILL BE ERRORS AND ISSUES.
