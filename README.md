# ‚ö†Ô∏è About 
The goal of Batlez is to improve frame rate, latency, connection, privacy, security, and overall performance. Batlez maximises and tweaks your PC for peak performance. You do not need to install any compiled software; simply run any simple script you want. It is free and open-source.


# üõë Getting Started 
This application works on Windows 10 21H1. I have not tested it on lower versions, and I do not recommend using it on them because tweaking the Regedit may cause system damage. Even though all of my Regedit tweaks are safe, I don't want any chance of causing harm to your system, so don't come crying to me if you have problems with Windows Vista after using it. I'm also not sure if this will work on Windows 11, so use caution!

**You MUST have an internet connection in order for the program to work.**
