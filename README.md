The goal of Batlez Tweaks is to improve frame rate, latency, connection, privacy, security, and overall performance. Batlez maximizes and tweaks your PC for peak performance. You do not need to install any compiled software; simply run any simple script you want. It is free and open-source. </h3>

## üõë Getting Started 
This application is **compatible with Windows 10**. I have had the chance to test it on every stable Windows release. If some things don't work as intended, please ensure you installed everything correctly or reinstall. I am not liable for any damage caused to your system, so don't come crying to me if your Windows has problems after using this. I'm also **unsure if this works on Windows 8 or 11** because I haven't had the chance to test them on their operating systems.

**You MUST have an internet connection for the program to work!!**
